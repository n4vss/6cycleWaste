6cycleWaste: E-waste Barter
Welcome to 6cycleWaste, an innovative web platform designed to tackle the growing problem of electronic waste (e-waste) through a unique bartering system. Our mission is to encourage responsible recycling and extend the lifecycle of electronic devices by connecting people who want to trade their old gadgets.

üìñ About The Project
The rapid pace of technological advancement has led to a significant increase in e-waste, which often ends up in landfills, posing a threat to our environment. 6cycleWaste offers a sustainable alternative. Instead of throwing away your old electronics, you can list them on our platform and trade them for items you need, all while contributing to a circular economy.

This project is based in Davao City, Philippines, aiming to provide a local solution to a global problem.
